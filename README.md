# Ymael - An ASCII-based 3D render engine 𝌭

Ymael can render render `.obj` models using ASCII characters in your terminal. The goal of building Ymael was the learn, at a lower-level, how rendering takes place. It's definitely not OpenGL and was not built to function as a robust 3D graphics engine. That said, I firmly believe code can be adapted to build a simple 3D game (something I _might_ do in the future).

## Notes
- If you want the displayed models to look proportionate, set the characters in your terminal window to have equal widths and heights
- Besides ncurses, which is used to push character to your terminal window, Ymael doesn't have any external dependencies
- It's ~~not very~~ performant 😉
